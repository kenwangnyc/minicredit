this project is for demostrative purpose how to use public data source API to instantly assess SME credit

the credit model is really a toy model, in reality it needs to be combined w/ other data sources such as tax or transaction data 

the code here demostrate the flow 


1) data retrieving modules (FB, twitter, etc) are called separately to retrieve data from respective sources and saved to a centralize location
2) credit assessment, this is independent of data retrieving, which might use multiple sources (including purchased), output is a single score ranging from (0,1)

example: 
python get_fb_data.py "capital grill" output_fb.csv
python get_tw_data.py "capital grill" output_tw.csv
python make_credit.py
